# Space Madness the Board Game the Computer Game

This is a digital version of Space Madness the Board Game that is changed in a couple of way to take advantage of the fact the computer can manage much of the game and setup. There is an attempt at a somewhat unorthadox use of a serverless webRTC on the backend so that you can have up to 5 players online.
