# Space Madness the Board Game the Computer Game

## [DEMO](https://robertpage.github.io/space-madness/)

This is a digital single player version of Space Madness the Board Game that is changed in a couple of ways to take advantage of the fact the computer can manage much of the game and setup. There are a couple of minor known cross-browser visual bugs but otherwise it should be completely playable.

## To Run
